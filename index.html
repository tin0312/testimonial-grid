        <p class="review">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in
          the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
        <p class="introduction">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
          course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
          grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
          Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p class="review">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>
        <p class="introduction">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile
          engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. “</p>

        <p class="review">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <p class="introduction">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
          structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
          former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
          ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

        <p class="review">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them
          and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
        <p class="introduction">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
          The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
          incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
